"""
This script is used for building standalone Windows executables of Informatic,
bundled with all the application's dependencies. cx_Freeze invokes distutils,
but for all installation and packaging tasks it is recommended that you use the
setup.py script instead.

Depending on the cx_Freeze version being used, one may have to copy libEGL.dll
by hand when building the Windows executable.
