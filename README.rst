Running or installing from source
---------------------------------

Running or installing Informatic from source requires that you have the
following dependencies installed first:

* Python 3
* PyQt5
* PyQt5.Qsci (the Qscintilla plugin for PyQt5, often included with PyQt5
  binaries)

You can install these on Debian-based Linux systems (like Ubuntu) with the
following command::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qsci

As of 19 January 2015, anyone using Ubuntu 14.10 "Utopic Unicorn" may have
difficulty running Informatic due to a bug in Ubuntu's official
``python3-pyqt5.qsci`` package, documented at
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qscintilla2/+bug/1391056>. This
problem is not known to affect Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty Tahr", the latest Long-Term
Service release.

To run Informatic from source without installing it simply run the script
``informatic.pyw`` using a Python 3 interpreter::

    python3 informatic.pyw

Remember to replace python3 with the name of the interpreter on your system. On
some systems it may be ``python`` or ``python34``.

To install Informatic, use the ``install`` command of the included ``setup.py``
script::

    sudo python3 setup.py install

After a successful installation, you should be able to run Informatic from the
command line with ``informatic``.

Running the "frozen" Windows package
------------------------------------

The "frozen" Windows package for Informatic comes with all the dependencies,
so you should only have to run ``informatic.exe``.
